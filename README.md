# Maternal Mortality Data Analysis Project
<!-- Edit the title above with your project title -->

## Project Overview
This project explores maternal mortality as a public health indicator, focusing on both U.S. and global trends between 2018 and 2023. Maternal mortality is not only a measure of healthcare quality but also a reflection of broader inequities in access, socioeconomic conditions, and policy effectiveness. Despite being a high-income nation, the United States has experienced rising maternal mortality rates in recent years, often exceeding those of peer countries. Globally, stark differences remain between regions, with low-income countries carrying the highest burden.

By analyzing datasets from the CDC, NCHS, and WHO, this project seeks to identify trends, regional disparities, and international comparisons. The findings can provide insight into where interventions are most urgently needed and contribute to ongoing discussions about improving maternal healthcare outcomes.

## Getting Started
### Installing Dependencies

To ensure that you have all the dependencies installed, and that we can have a reproducible environment, we will be using `pipenv` to manage our dependencies. `pipenv` is a tool that allows us to create a virtual environment for our project, and install all the dependencies we need for our project. This ensures that we can have a reproducible environment, and that we can all run the same code.

```bash
pipenv install
```

This sets up a virtual environment for our project, and installs the following dependencies:

- `ipykernel`
- `jupyter`
- `notebook`
- `black`
  Throughout your analysis and development, you will need to install additional packages. You can can install any package you need using `pipenv install <package-name>`. For example, if you need to install `numpy`, you can do so by running:

```bash
pipenv install numpy
```

This will update update the `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` files, and install the package in your virtual environment.
